My Website Project is called WristBand, it is a website for users to posts
about concerts that they have been to, in order to log songs seen live.

The Website's data is made up of two entities, users and posts.
They have a one-to-many relationship, one user can have many posts.

Each User includes a profile picture variable that has it's own GET and POST requests;
it is an image entity with a one-to-one relationship with their respective user entities.

The functionality of the website is made up of searching through and adding to data about
users and user's posts.
